# Biostatistics-for-Physicians

This repository houses materials I'm working on to introduce biostatistics to the medical students, residents, and fellows I work with at the Cleveland Clinic. The material is NOT remotely original, mostly being based on example data sets from JMP (https://www.jmp.com/en_us/home.html) and course materials from the Data Science course taught by [Dr. Tom Love](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE) at CWRU. Tom Love is my graduate school advisor and I owe him a huge debt of gratitude for framing my own understanding of statistics.

[Part I](Part_1_visualizations.pdf) is available now, and basically takes the reader through some basic definitions and common visualizations seen in statistical work. I'm still working on Part II (making comparisons) and Part III (basic regression analysis) and will upload those soon when available.

Note: to access the links in the text the reader needs to actually DOWNLOAD the material to his or her own computer.
