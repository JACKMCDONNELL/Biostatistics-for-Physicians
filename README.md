# Biostatistics-for-Physicians

This repository houses materials I'm working on to introduce biostatistics to the medical students, residents, and fellows I work with at the Cleveland Clinic. The material is NOT remotely original, mostly being based on example data sets from JMP (https://www.jmp.com/en_us/home.html) and course materials from the Data Science course taught by Dr. Tom Love at CWRU. Tom Love is my graduate school advisor and I owe him a huge debt of gratitude for framing my own understanding of statistics.

Part I is available now, and basically takes the reader through some basic definitions and common visualizations seen in statistical work. I'm still working on Part II (making comparisons) and Part III (basic regression analysis) and will upload those soon when available.

Note: to access the materials the reader needs to right click and DOWNLOAD the material to their own computer. Github won't allow you to see the materials otherwise (it gives an error message).
